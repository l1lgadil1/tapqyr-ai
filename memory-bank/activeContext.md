# Active Context: TapqyrAI

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the development phase with a focus on building out the authentication system and core task management functionality. Based on the file exploration, we can see that the auth middleware component is being implemented, which is a critical part of the security infrastructure.

### Active Components

1. **Authentication System**
   - JWT-based authentication middleware
   - User registration and login flows
   - Token validation and blacklisting

2. **Task Management Core**
   - Basic CRUD operations for tasks
   - Task data model design
   - API endpoints for task manipulation

3. **Project Infrastructure**
   - Project structure following Feature-Sliced Design
   - Development environment setup
   - Build and deployment configuration

## Recent Changes

Recent work has focused on implementing the authentication middleware with the following features:
- Token validation and verification
- User identification from tokens
- Optional authentication for certain routes
- Development mode debugging support

The auth-middleware.ts file shows implementation of both mandatory and optional authentication middleware, with support for development-only debug tokens.

## Next Steps

Based on the current state of the project, the following next steps are prioritized:

### Short-term Tasks

1. **Complete Authentication System**
   - Implement user registration functionality
   - Create login/logout flows
   - Add password reset capabilities
   - Set up email verification

2. **Develop Basic Task Management**
   - Implement task CRUD API endpoints
   - Create task list UI components
   - Develop task filtering and sorting
   - Add basic task status tracking

3. **Set Up Database Schema**
   - Define Prisma models for users and tasks
   - Create initial migrations
   - Seed development database with test data

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Implement AI Integration**
   - Set up OpenAI API connection
   - Create task generation prompts
   - Develop response parsing logic
   - Build UI for AI task generation

2. **Enhance User Experience**
   - Implement dark/light mode
   - Add responsive design for mobile
   - Create smooth transitions and animations
   - Develop 3D task visualizations

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Standardize error responses
   - Add client-side validation
   - Implement error logging
   - Create user-friendly error messages

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Authentication Strategy**
   - Using JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
   - Token blacklisting for security
   - Implementation of optional authentication for public/private data

2. **Database Design**
   - Considering relationship between users and tasks
   - Planning task categorization and tagging system
   - Evaluating performance implications of task history tracking

3. **AI Implementation Approach**
   - Evaluating direct OpenAI API integration vs. custom middleware
   - Considering prompt engineering for optimal task generation
   - Planning caching strategy to minimize API costs

### Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Need to optimize 3D visualizations for performance
   - Considering lazy loading for components
   - Planning for efficient API request batching

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Token expiration and refresh strategy
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Protection against common attack vectors

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Setting up comprehensive documentation
   - Creating consistent coding standards
   - Implementing useful dev tools and debugging features

## Current Challenges

1. **Authentication Edge Cases**
   - Handling token expiration during active sessions
   - Managing concurrent logins from multiple devices
   - Balancing security with user convenience

2. **AI Integration Complexity**
   - Ensuring consistent quality of AI-generated tasks
   - Managing API costs with increasing user base
   - Creating natural language parsing for effective results

3. **Technical Debt Management**
   - Ensuring test coverage for critical components
   - Maintaining documentation as features evolve
   - Planning for scalability as the application grows
