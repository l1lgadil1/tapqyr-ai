# TapqyrAI - Smart Task List with AI

## Project Overview
TapqyrAI is a modern web application for task management that leverages artificial intelligence to optimize the planning process. The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks (CRUD), as well as use AI to automatically generate structured tasks based on text prompts.

## Core Requirements

### Authentication System
- User registration, login, and logout functionality
- Secure access to user data
- JWT-based authentication

### Task Management (CRUD)
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks manually
- Task categorization and prioritization
- Deadline setting and reminder functions

### AI-Powered Task Generation
- Users can provide a prompt (e.g., "I want to learn programming")
- AI generates structured tasks with subtasks (e.g., "Choose a programming language", "Create a learning schedule", etc.)

### AI-Driven Task Automation
- AI can automatically create, update, or delete tasks based on user behavior or input
- AI suggests improvements or modifications to task lists

### Task Completion Tracking
- Mark tasks as completed
- Progress tracking and analytics

### User Experience Enhancements
- Dark mode support
- Notifications and reminders (email, push notifications)
- Cross-device synchronization

## Technology Stack
